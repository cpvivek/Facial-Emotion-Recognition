# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

# Introduction
Evolution of computer vision and neural networks has helped AI find it's spot right in the heart of many real life applications. Facial emotion recognition is one such application. AI enitites that can recogonize a person's emotion and act accordingly just might be the next big step in the AI assistant market. Analyzing emotions of students in a class room can help teachers to provide assistance accordingly. The application extends to many such use cases.

Here I have developed a facial emotion recognition model using CNN structure and deploy it as an web app in real time using stream lit.
